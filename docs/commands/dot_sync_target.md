## dot sync target

Show or set the sync target (local mirror dir or SSH remote)

### Synopsis

With no argument, prints the resolved sync target.

With a spec, sets the target in this workspace's local config
(<workspace>/.dotfiles/sync/config.yaml) so it takes effect immediately.
Accepted forms:

  local:~/Dropbox/work       local directory (a cloud client's folder)
  ssh:user@host:~/work       rsync over SSH
  ~/Dropbox/work             bare path — shorthand for local:

The target belongs to this workspace: it is written only to that store's
config.yaml, and another workspace keeps its own. A workspace with no
target of its own syncs to the detected cloud folder.

```
dot sync target [spec] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for target
```
