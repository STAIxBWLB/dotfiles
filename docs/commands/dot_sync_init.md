## dot sync init

Initialize <workspace>/.dotfiles/sync/ from current state

### Synopsis

One-time onboarding for the per-workspace store. Creates
<workspace>/.dotfiles/sync/ with config.yaml, include.txt, exclude.txt,
ignore.txt, manifests, log dir; appends '/.dotfiles/' to <workspace>/.gitignore
so the store is never committed; and creates <workspace>/inbox/gdrive/ if
missing.

Idempotent — re-running on a populated store leaves operator edits intact and
just heals any missing pieces.

```
dot sync init [flags]
```

### Options

  -h, --help   help for init
```
